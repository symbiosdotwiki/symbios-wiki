At the time I was studying a lot of quantum information theory and was probably the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life; I dreamt of escaping my finite reality into the unending world of information. After graduating from University with a degree in mathematics, I’ve spent five years working as an art-world freelancer in Brooklyn. I work almost exclusively on the computer: rendering, arduinos, websites; I even tutor through webchat. On the one hand, my informatic intimacy has kept me largely alienated from physical reality, trapped in obtuse theory. On the other hand it has helped me to slowly reify as a non-binary cyborg goddess, a devout humanist obsessed with the practical affect of aesthetics.\nFor me, the internet has been a tool for gaining empathy through its ability to host and distribute diverse perspectives. The more my body has dissolved into the virtual, the more I have been able to resimulate the emotional experiences of others. I am now interested in how we move beyond a theory of utopia to the project of a protopia, always working to make tomorrow a little better. I’ve looked towards quantum information theory to help to understand and reconcile the seemingly infinite spectrum of realities we call our universe. This is the new vision of Isomov.”\n\n‘In Theory’ sets divergent impulses in motion, animating superheated exchanges between order and entropy, flesh and code. ‘Origin, Emergence, and The One’ is a false utopia where differing cultures come together in restless harmony despite their aesthetic differences: frictious dancehall percussion and grandiose choral washes parry and twine, constantly threatening to subsume the other. ‘Hoping Mechanisms’ takes place at the critical point of identification, when the named object of perfection becomes a radical dystopia of conflicting binaries. Rarely have we heard kicks so exuberantly scattered or bass so charred — Uncanny Valley rendered as a scorched, inhospitable territory. ‘Ensemble’ shows the reality of a cyborg beyond binaries, the coexistence of a fictional ideology with the chaos of lived reality. A panicked voice is met with grounding sub bass, over which a superposition of arpeggiated chords glide. An emergent meter forms through an unseen grid before everything chaotically decoheres, revealing its ultimate fragility. ‘Wavelet’ is an attempt to describe the emergent and chaotic self through convolution and principal component decomposition. Identity is revealed via dizzying arrays of Moire patterns as rhythms slide over one another under liquefying bass pulses.\n‘Memory Loops’ grapples with the inherent traumas present in any stochastic system, the vestigial remnants of code in everything’s DNA. We never escape reliving the consequences of these boundary conditions which define the historical trajectory of becoming.\n‘In Theory’ conjures a hologram of emergence, an ecology of a self attempting to overcome each passing moment’s complexities in a bid for metastability. Oscillating fervently between the human and non-human, the EP offers riches for both cerebral listening and large soundsystem bodywork.\n\nA limited edition physical release of ‘In Theory’ is available in the form of a WiFi-enabled interactive visualizer trapped in a small holographic sculpture.

infamous \"Bird In Space\", [@birds_without_space](https://www.instagram.com/birds_without_space/) represents the 9 most \"evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered\" avian species in the world due to human-related habitat loss. (You can check out [edgeofexistence.org](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/birds/) for their complete list of species). The accompanying video piece seeks to explore the banality of such ecological horrors by flattening the traditional sculpture into a 3D render synthesizing some the largest contributors of habitat loss for these birds.\n\n\nThe images and video in the piece are all cropped at 4x5 ratio and rotated 90 degrees which maximizes the amount of space media can take up on Instagram. In choosing Instagram as the platform and framing the piece in this way I hope to provide these birds with the maximum amount of virtual space where they can repopulate symbolically through the sharing of their image. By appropriating the medium of hyper-real renderings most often used in architecture/realty and advertising, I hope to subvert these practices which allow profiting from the exploitation of land.\n\n\nWhen discussing ecological horrors such as the loss of species I find the language of the Sublime and the Real to help express the ineffable magnitude of such losses. In “The Return of the Real” Hal Foster discusses techniques such as illusionism, gaze, and repetition which artists such as Gober, Sherman, and Warhol, respectively, have used in order to focus their art upon the Real. \n\n\nThe scene takes place in an old-fashioned office and this recreation of a hyper-real office space was motivated Foster’s comment that \"illusionism [for Gober] is employed not to cover up the real with simulacral surfaces but to uncover it in uncanny things\". Living in contemporary American society makes participating in our economy of environmental havoc inevitable; we are constantly surrounded by the disastrously mundane things such as timber, meat, and electricity. The POV camera was chosen to show this trapped subject, browsing Instagram, as self-surveying, “not in phenomenological immanence (I see myself seeing myself) but in psychological estrangement (I am not what I imagined myself to be)”.\n\n\nThe extremely nontraumatic and docile act of scrolling through Instagram is repeated in a choppy loop, ad infinitum, like a reversal of Warhol’s famous “Death and Disaster” series. Here our collective trauma is not a visible horror, but a mass complacency due to the filtering of horror through the hyper-real lens of media. It feels as if the impending mass extinction \"will not occur\". We have seen too many “gruesome picture[s] over and over again”, and now they “don’t really have any effect”. Thus, this complacent scrolling “must be repeated” but only serves to remind us of the disasters we are ignoring. This is where Foster claims “the Real ruptures the screen of repetition” and it is the now the subject that is “touched by an image”.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sarah, Nicole, and Josh for their input.\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.3611111111% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div><p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMja08yDL9c/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\">A video posted by Symbios (@symbios.wiki)</a> on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:00:49+00:00\">Nov 8, 2016 at 7:00am PST</time></p></div></blockquote>\n<script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\n","data":{"layout":"media","title":"birds_without_space","tags":{"categories":["3d"]},"blurb":"birds_without_space","ads":false,"share":false,"show_url":true,"show_blurb":true,"video":{"id":190726475},"photoset":{"id":"72157674981412101"},"featured":0},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","filename":"2016-11-11-birds_without_space.md","postPreview":{"key":"birds_without_space","ref":null,"props":{"ID":53,"content":"\nInspired by Brancusi's infamous \"Bird In Space\", [@birds_without_space](https://www.instagram.com/birds_without_space/) represents the 9 most \"evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered\" avian species in the world due to human-related habitat loss.

The piece is a contemporary take on Kosuth’s *One and Three Chairs*; my interest in his piece is inspired by Graham Harman’s interpretation of DeLanda’s Assemblage Theory. Kosuth’s set of chairs forced the locus of his piece to be the chair that wasn’t present, the Real chair which is never captured in representation or reification. My extension of his logic uses a specific Egyptian obelisk. Instead of focusing on object, image, and definition, I instead chose to focus on commodity, simulation, and historical document. This was an attempt to extend the locus of the piece to not just include a Real object, but also the temporality of that object. \n\nThe object has been presented as a commodity. A commodity object is the Actual reified, in both the sense of actualization and Marxist objectification. I chose the obelisk as my specific object because of its prototypical characteristics with respect to the history of sculpture. The light sculpture aspect is meant to exemplify the mythological roots of the obelisk. The luminosity of the piece was achieved by shining an x-shaped laser through a tube of liquid which is periodically rotated with a microcontroller.\n\nThe image has been presented as an historical document. The history of an object is a trace of its Indices, the set of its Causal relations with other objects in time. I chose to use text annotated with images due to Krauss’ statement that “a meaninglessness surrounds [an image] which can only be filled with the addition of text.” The historical research is documented within a museum-like poster titled Artificial Dissemination which takes from Derrida’s discussion of the pharmakon in terms of the latent phallic nature of the obelisk. This psychoanalytic latency throughout the text is included to confuse the Krauss’ dichotomy of physical Index and representation as filtered through a privileged conscious observer in order to stress the flatness of object-oriented interactions.\n\nThe definition is presented as a simulation, both being virtualizations of a Real object.

The piece is a contemporary take on Kosuth’s *One and Three Chairs*; my interest in his piece is inspired by Graham Harman’s interpretation of DeLanda’s Assemblage Theory. Kosuth’s set of chairs forced the locus of his piece to be the chair that wasn’t present, the Real chair which is never captured in representation or reification. My extension of his logic uses a specific Egyptian obelisk. Instead of focusing on object, image, and definition, I instead chose to focus on commodity, simulation, and historical document. This was an attempt to extend the locus of the piece to not just include a Real object, but also the temporality of that object. \n\nThe object has been presented as a commodity. A commodity object is the Actual reified, in both the sense of actualization and Marxist objectification. I chose the obelisk as my specific object because of its prototypical characteristics with respect to the history of sculpture. The light sculpture aspect is meant to exemplify the mythological roots of the obelisk. The luminosity of the piece was achieved by shining an x-shaped laser through a tube of liquid which is periodically rotated with a microcontroller.\n\nThe image has been presented as an historical document. The history of an object is a trace of its Indices, the set of its Causal relations with other objects in time. I chose to use text annotated with images due to Krauss’ statement that “a meaninglessness surrounds [an image] which can only be filled with the addition of text.” The historical research is documented within a museum-like poster titled Artificial Dissemination which takes from Derrida’s discussion of the pharmakon in terms of the latent phallic nature of the obelisk. This psychoanalytic latency throughout the text is included to confuse the Krauss’ dichotomy of physical Index and representation as filtered through a privileged conscious observer in order to stress the flatness of object-oriented interactions.\n\nThe definition is presented as a simulation, both being virtualizations of a Real object. This simulation was achieved by painstakingly recreating the liquid tube within a fluid simulator and then simulating the caustics of an x-shaped light source through the fluid inside a sphere within the computer.

Visitors were invited to plunge their hands into the ice tank which would then communicate with the visualization and cause it to slowly change over the course of the exhibition. The uncomfortable nature of this act, and the incremental change effected were intended to parallel to the ardous process of activism.\n\nThis piece was accomplished with various technologies. The ice tank used an infrared light sensor to detect when hands were inside of the ice tank and then used a microcontroller and miniature computer to send the data via OSC to the visualization component. The visualization was created using webGL and hosted with a local Node.js server to accept the OSC data. The visualization utilized a ray marching algorithm to approximate a 3D projection of a 4D Julia set. The data correspondence relayed the length of time each person kept their hands submerged and this data was used to advect the various constants which produce the Julia set. The Julia set began as a simple sphere and transformed over the course of the night into a complex geometrical object.

Participants were asked to observe the data representing the amount of money the ASIC was generating and the amount of energy it was using. They were then asked to vote for whether the ASIC should be stopped or left to generate more money. The money generated would be donated to the non-profit 350.org.\n\nUsing a mining pool, we were able to generate fractions of bitcoins to donate in a small period of time. The power drawn from the device was measured using a microcontroller and plotted using matplotlib. The voting system was created using a Python wrapper for the Twitter API with pre-specific hashtags to trigger the voting system.\n\n**The Breath Connector** was meant to allow the participants to empathize with nature and each other. A large plexiglass cube containing a small garden was too dark to see into at the beginning of the show. There was a facemask which allowed the participants to breath into the cube. The more CO2 present in the cube, the brighter the lights inside of the cube would get, revealing the garden inside.\n\nThe increase of CO2 was measured using a CO2 sensor and microcontroller.
