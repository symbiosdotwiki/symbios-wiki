At the time I was studying a lot of quantum information theory and was probably the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life; I dreamt of escaping my finite reality into the unending world of information. After graduating from University with a degree in mathematics, I’ve spent five years working as an art-world freelancer in Brooklyn. I work almost exclusively on the computer: rendering, arduinos, websites; I even tutor through webchat. On the one hand, my informatic intimacy has kept me largely alienated from physical reality, trapped in obtuse theory. On the other hand it has helped me to slowly reify as a non-binary cyborg goddess, a devout humanist obsessed with the practical affect of aesthetics.\nFor me, the internet has been a tool for gaining empathy through its ability to host and distribute diverse perspectives. The more my body has dissolved into the virtual, the more I have been able to resimulate the emotional experiences of others. I am now interested in how we move beyond a theory of utopia to the project of a protopia, always working to make tomorrow a little better. I’ve looked towards quantum information theory to help to understand and reconcile the seemingly infinite spectrum of realities we call our universe. This is the new vision of Isomov.”\n\n‘In Theory’ sets divergent impulses in motion, animating superheated exchanges between order and entropy, flesh and code. ‘Origin, Emergence, and The One’ is a false utopia where differing cultures come together in restless harmony despite their aesthetic differences: frictious dancehall percussion and grandiose choral washes parry and twine, constantly threatening to subsume the other. ‘Hoping Mechanisms’ takes place at the critical point of identification, when the named object of perfection becomes a radical dystopia of conflicting binaries. Rarely have we heard kicks so exuberantly scattered or bass so charred — Uncanny Valley rendered as a scorched, inhospitable territory. ‘Ensemble’ shows the reality of a cyborg beyond binaries, the coexistence of a fictional ideology with the chaos of lived reality. A panicked voice is met with grounding sub bass, over which a superposition of arpeggiated chords glide. An emergent meter forms through an unseen grid before everything chaotically decoheres, revealing its ultimate fragility. ‘Wavelet’ is an attempt to describe the emergent and chaotic self through convolution and principal component decomposition. Identity is revealed via dizzying arrays of Moire patterns as rhythms slide over one another under liquefying bass pulses.\n‘Memory Loops’ grapples with the inherent traumas present in any stochastic system, the vestigial remnants of code in everything’s DNA.

At the time I was studying a lot of quantum information theory and was probably the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life; I dreamt of escaping my finite reality into the unending world of information. After graduating from University with a degree in mathematics, I’ve spent five years working as an art-world freelancer in Brooklyn. I work almost exclusively on the computer: rendering, arduinos, websites; I even tutor through webchat. On the one hand, my informatic intimacy has kept me largely alienated from physical reality, trapped in obtuse theory. On the other hand it has helped me to slowly reify as a non-binary cyborg goddess, a devout humanist obsessed with the practical affect of aesthetics.\nFor me, the internet has been a tool for gaining empathy through its ability to host and distribute diverse perspectives. The more my body has dissolved into the virtual, the more I have been able to resimulate the emotional experiences of others. I am now interested in how we move beyond a theory of utopia to the project of a protopia, always working to make tomorrow a little better. I’ve looked towards quantum information theory to help to understand and reconcile the seemingly infinite spectrum of realities we call our universe. This is the new vision of Isomov.”\n\n‘In Theory’ sets divergent impulses in motion, animating superheated exchanges between order and entropy, flesh and code. ‘Origin, Emergence, and The One’ is a false utopia where differing cultures come together in restless harmony despite their aesthetic differences: frictious dancehall percussion and grandiose choral washes parry and twine, constantly threatening to subsume the other. ‘Hoping Mechanisms’ takes place at the critical point of identification, when the named object of perfection becomes a radical dystopia of conflicting binaries. Rarely have we heard kicks so exuberantly scattered or bass so charred — Uncanny Valley rendered as a scorched, inhospitable territory. ‘Ensemble’ shows the reality of a cyborg beyond binaries, the coexistence of a fictional ideology with the chaos of lived reality. A panicked voice is met with grounding sub bass, over which a superposition of arpeggiated chords glide. An emergent meter forms through an unseen grid before everything chaotically decoheres, revealing its ultimate fragility. ‘Wavelet’ is an attempt to describe the emergent and chaotic self through convolution and principal component decomposition. Identity is revealed via dizzying arrays of Moire patterns as rhythms slide over one another under liquefying bass pulses.\n‘Memory Loops’ grapples with the inherent traumas present in any stochastic system, the vestigial remnants of code in everything’s DNA. We never escape reliving the consequences of these boundary conditions which define the historical trajectory of becoming.\n‘In Theory’ conjures a hologram of emergence, an ecology of a self attempting to overcome each passing moment’s complexities in a bid for metastability. Oscillating fervently between the human and non-human, the EP offers riches for both cerebral listening and large soundsystem bodywork.\n\nA limited edition physical release of ‘In Theory’ is available in the form of a WiFi-enabled interactive visualizer trapped in a small holographic sculpture.

part of the show EXO EMO at Greene Naftali, curated by Antoine Catala, I created custom software for Momoyo Torimitsu which would allow users to select a type of professional smile and would then apply that smile to a blank-face photo of the user and show this as a video animation.

infamous \"Bird In Space\", [@birds_without_space](https://www.instagram.com/birds_without_space/) represents the 9 most \"evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered\" avian species in the world due to human-related habitat loss. (You can check out [edgeofexistence.org](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/birds/) for their complete list of species). The accompanying video piece seeks to explore the banality of such ecological horrors by flattening the traditional sculpture into a 3D render synthesizing some the largest contributors of habitat loss for these birds.\n\n\nThe images and video in the piece are all cropped at 4x5 ratio and rotated 90 degrees which maximizes the amount of space media can take up on Instagram. In choosing Instagram as the platform and framing the piece in this way I hope to provide these birds with the maximum amount of virtual space where they can repopulate symbolically through the sharing of their image. By appropriating the medium of hyper-real renderings most often used in architecture/realty and advertising, I hope to subvert these practices which allow profiting from the exploitation of land.\n\n\nWhen discussing ecological horrors such as the loss of species I find the language of the Sublime and the Real to help express the ineffable magnitude of such losses. In “The Return of the Real” Hal Foster discusses techniques such as illusionism, gaze, and repetition which artists such as Gober, Sherman, and Warhol, respectively, have used in order to focus their art upon the Real. \n\n\nThe scene takes place in an old-fashioned office and this recreation of a hyper-real office space was motivated Foster’s comment that \"illusionism [for Gober] is employed not to cover up the real with simulacral surfaces but to uncover it in uncanny things\". Living in contemporary American society makes participating in our economy of environmental havoc inevitable; we are constantly surrounded by the disastrously mundane things such as timber, meat, and electricity. The POV camera was chosen to show this trapped subject, browsing Instagram, as self-surveying, “not in phenomenological immanence (I see myself seeing myself) but in psychological estrangement (I am not what I imagined myself to be)”.\n\n\nThe extremely nontraumatic and docile act of scrolling through Instagram is repeated in a choppy loop, ad infinitum, like a reversal of Warhol’s famous “Death and Disaster” series. Here our collective trauma is not a visible horror, but a mass complacency due to the filtering of horror through the hyper-real lens of media. It feels as if the impending mass extinction \"will not occur\". We have seen too many “gruesome picture[s] over and over again”, and now they “don’t really have any effect”. Thus, this complacent scrolling “must be repeated” but only serves to remind us of the disasters we are ignoring. This is where Foster claims “the Real ruptures the screen of repetition” and it is the now the subject that is “touched by an image”.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sarah, Nicole, and Josh for their input.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"padding:8px;\"\u003e \u003cdiv style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.3611111111% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"\u003e \u003cdiv style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMja08yDL9c/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA video posted by Symbios (@symbios.wiki)\u003c/a\u003e on \u003ctime style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:00:49+00:00\"\u003eNov 8, 2016 at 7:00am PST\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n","data":{"layout":"media","title":"birds_without_space","tags":{"categories":["3d"]},"blurb":"birds_without_space","ads":false,"share":false,"show_url":true,"show_blurb":true,"video":{"id":190726475},"photoset":{"id":"72157674981412101"},"featured":0},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","filename":"2016-11-11-birds_without_space.md","postPreview":{"key":"birds_without_space","ref":null,"props":{"ID":53,"content":"\nInspired by Brancusi's infamous \"Bird In Space\", [@birds_without_space](https://www.instagram.com/birds_without_space/) represents the 9 most \"evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered\" avian species in the world due to human-related habitat loss.

For this series I wanted to imagine a future where we no longer need to harvest and poach animals for their aesthetic properties. In order for this dream to become reality, there will need to be artists who are dedicated to creating an alternative aesthetic. My approach to this problem involved hyper-lifelike renditions of snake skin, animal fur, bird feathers, and brain coral.

The visualization utilized a ray marching algorithm to approximate a 3D projection of a 4D Julia set. The data correspondence relayed the length of time each person kept their hands submerged and this data was used to advect the various constants which produce the Julia set.

I hope this materialization pulls viewers in, both physically and mentally, and asks them to participate in the autonomy of the piece.","data":{"layout":"media","title":"I am ___.","tags":{"categories":["physical"]},"ads":false,"share":false,"image":{"id":22352874371},"photoset":{"id":"72157660097616252"},"featured":0},"SC":null,"Vimeo":null,"animLength":30},"_owner":null}},{"content":"\nBorromean Resistance is a collaboration between Sarah Scott and myself.\n\n\u0026nbsp; Performance one proposed a simplified model of activism as feedback in a complex system.
