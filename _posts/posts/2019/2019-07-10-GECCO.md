I worked with Joel to bring his evolved corals to life for the GECCO 2019 Virtual Creatures Competition, where we were finalists. The base mesh for the corals was acheived by using morphgenetic neural nets which considered light and novelty for growth over hundreds of generations. The final meshes were done procedurally in Houdini to add polyp geometry to the base meshes. The final renders were done in C4D with Octane render.
