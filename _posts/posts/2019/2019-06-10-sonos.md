I worked with Dave and Gabe to develop a pipeline for shader effects for a 3D pixel array using custom 1D GLSL shaders. They then spatialized the stems from Holly Herndon's track "Eternal" inside Ableton and sequenced the effects out of Ableton with TDAbleton. The event was hosted by Sonos and Google.
