Isaka - H34T D34TH (superN0V4)

A breakup song I started in late 2020. It took a few years to finish the three sections of the song which represent the various stages of the relationship in reverse chronological order. The track features elements of club, techno, opera, happy hardcore, and hyperpop. In keeping with the space theme, the song has an opera melody based on a blues record NASA sent into space (Dark Was the Night), and lyrics from the D15n3y movie Zenon.
