I worked with Bell Curve to develop an interactive website and album cover for her album DEEP END. This required first modelling multiple 3D balloon animals within Marvekous designer that were then textured suing a custom Stable Diffusion workslow with Photoshop and Houdini. I then created a pipeline within Houdini to export web-optimized models with a bespoke GLTF pipeline that is loaded online with React Three Fiber and Next.js.
