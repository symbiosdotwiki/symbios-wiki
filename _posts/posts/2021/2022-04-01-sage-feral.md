I worked with Sage to help them curate works for their solo exhibition Primordium with Feral File. Texts for the show included the curatorial text Becoming Ooze, an interview with Sage and Casey Reas, and descriptions of each artwork. I also assisted Sage with technical aspects of converting their work from OpenFrameworks to WebGL.
