Replication of the paper "A common developmental program can produce diverse leaf shapes" by Dr. Adam Runions, et al. within Houdini [PAPER](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.14449). 

Includes details from his Ph.D thesis which were missing from the paper, see [THESIS](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/runionsa.th2014.html).

Generally the process in Houdini involved a lot of VEX to create  polyline remeshing algorithms for the leaf margin morphogenesis.

Textures were generated using the space colonization and Delauney graphs, [VENATION PAPER](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/venation.sig2005.html).

Venation polylines were then converted to textures using COPs within Houdini.

I also developed a custom conformal map algorithm to create consistent UV maps between the inital and final frames of the leaf morphogensis.
