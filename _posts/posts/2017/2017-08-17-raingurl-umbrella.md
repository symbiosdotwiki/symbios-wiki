As Art Director of of the music video for Yaeji's Raingurl, I outfitted a commercially-available umbrella with a custom lighting unit powered by an ESP8266 with 5050 LEDs that was controlled via WiFi from my laptop on set. This allowed us to quickly converge on the desired look for any shot. I also produced VFX for the video abd directed lighting on set.
