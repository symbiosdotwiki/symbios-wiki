In collaboration with Llyr x Lindred

In "Biotic Unraveling" by Llyr, Lindred, and @symbios.wiki, a lush and sentimental landscape representing healthy and abundant biodiversity is punctuated and disrupted by percussive impacts and textural abrasions whose intensity inversely track trends from the Living Planet Report 2022 (WWF/ZSL), which shows averaged relative population levels for studied animal populations since 1970. Curves for five geographic regions drive selected parameters of distinct sounds, allowing the listener to hear their differing trajectories, while the global ‘Living Planet Index’ curve controls the retrigger rate of an all-encompassing thud illustrating an average relative decline of 69% over the course of the piece.

The artistic data sonification is intertwined with thousands of AI-generated images to create a homage to both Godfrey Reggio’s iconic film "Koyaanisquatsi" and John Michael Boling’s video for Oneohtrix Point Never’s "Boring Angel". This technique, a deliberate pastiche, probes the ironic nature of reproducing and consuming art in the digital age, where "poor images"—low-resolution, easily reproducible, and often devalued—serve as the raw material for artistic sincerity. 

The result is an audio-visual artwork that confronts the urgent issue of diminishing biodiversity on Earth through the lens of data sonification and artificial intelligence; simultaneously provoking reflection on ecological, or ‘biotic’, degradation and the decline of the communication mediums which have the power to drive awareness and change.



The starting point of this piece was a synth and vocal soundscape layered alongside a natural field recording. Data curves representing averaged population trends globally and regionally were then printed as automation curves in Ableton Live and mapped to parameter macros related to auditory intensity of a selection of percussive and textural sounds. Becoming more intense with downward trends in biodiversity and less intense with relative increases, we can hear the lush soundscape being interfered with in tandem with these changes. Visually we see diminishing biodiversity translated into thousands of AI-generated images created using a data-driven prompt matrix, machine information retrieval techniques, and 3D images of Earth within ComfyUI and Touchdesigner.
