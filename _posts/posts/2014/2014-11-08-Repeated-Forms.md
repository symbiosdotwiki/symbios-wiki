&nbsp; &nbsp; In this piece I hoped to convey the failure of the futurists. Boccioni's "Unique Froms of Continuity in Space" is stuck in place rotating over itself instead of moving forward. The aesthetics are borrowed from the Vaporwave movement in order to convey the over-saturated and accelerationist demise of the Futurists.

&nbsp; &nbsp; This piece was shown at the Tate Britain during their "All Glitched Up" show in November 2014.
